# **Weather Type Prediction Based on Historical Data**

## **Project Description**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the type of weather based on historical weather data.

## **Objective**

To create a robust machine learning model capable of predicting weather types using historical weather data, providing valuable insights into weather patterns.

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes the following weather features:
- **Date/Time**
- **Temp_C** (Temperature in Celsius)
- **Dew Point Temp_C** (Dew Point Temperature in Celsius)
- **Rel Hum_%** (Relative Humidity in percentage)
- **Wind Speed_km/h** (Wind Speed in kilometers per hour)
- **Visibility_km** (Visibility in kilometers)
- **Press_kPa** (Pressure in kilopascals)
- **Weather type** (Categorical weather type)

## **Approach**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize numerical features to ensure consistent scaling.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Create new features to enhance model performance, such as:
  - Time of day
  - Day of the week
  - Seasonal indicators

### **3. Model Selection**
- Experiment with various machine learning algorithms suitable for multi-class classification, including:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

### **5. Model Deployment**
- Deploy the best-performing model for real-time weather predictions.

## **Expected Outcomes**

- A robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting weather types based on the provided features.
- Insights into the factors influencing weather patterns and their relative importance.
- Potential applications in fields such as agriculture, transportation, and tourism.
